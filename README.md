# JBX Contribution NFT Reward Mechanism

## Motivation

If added to an existing project via a funding cycle, NFT rewards can provide additional incentive for contributors to participate in funding of a project.

# Install Foundry

To get set up:

1. Install [Foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry).

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | sh
```

2. Install external lib(s)

```bash
git submodule update --init && yarn install
```

then run

```bash
forge update
```

If git modules are failing to clone, not installing, etc (ie overall submodule misbehaving), use `git submodule update --init --recursive --force`

3. Run tests:

```bash
forge test
```

4. Update Foundry periodically:

```bash
foundryup
```

#### Setup

Configure the .env variables, and add a mnemonic.txt file with the mnemonic of the deployer wallet. The sender address in the .env must correspond to the mnemonic account.

## Rinkeby

```bash
yarn deploy-rinkeby
```

## Mainnet

```bash
yarn deploy-mainnet
```

The deployments are stored in ./broadcast

See the [Foundry Book for available options](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-create.html).
